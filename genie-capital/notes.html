      <p>XAF 10,000,000 at 1% per week. Fixed Rate Notes due 2024</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3 class="py-5">The Business</h3>
      <p> The proceeds of these Notes will be used to fund the acquisition of Rents Rights of properties worth at least
        4x the Investment Amount.</p>
      <p> The product, Property Management by Genie Capital, was designed to provide professional property management
        services to landlords who value their peace of mind. However, the market wanted more.
        From our work in the field, we realised many landlords are willing to accept an Advance Payment and handover
        their property over to us. It is with regards to this direction that we are fundraising.</p>
      <p> With 10 million F CFA, over a period of 1 year, we will generate Rents Rights of at least 40 million F CFA.
        The Rents Rights are directly converted to Rents Revenue that when sold would lead to a markup of at least 20%.
        Thus 10 million F CFA can be used to generate a Gross Margin of at least 8 million F CFA.</p>

    <div>
      <h3 class="py-5">Risk Factors</h3>
      <p>Any investment in the Notes is subject to a number of risks. Prior to investing in the Notes, prospective
        inves- tors should carefully consider risk factors associated with any investment in the Notes,
        the business of the Issuer and the industry in which it operates together with all other information contained
        in this Prospectus, including, in particular, the risk factors described below.
        The Issuer considers such risk factors to be the prin- cipal risk factors that may affect the Issuer's ability
        to fulfil its obligations under the Notes and/or risk factors that are material for the purposes of assessing
        the market risk associated with the Notes.
        Words and expressions defined in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes or elsewhere in this Prospectus have the
        same meanings in this section.</p>
      <p>The following is not an exhaustive list or explanation of all risks which investors may face when making an
        investment in the Notes and should be used as guidance only. Additional risks and uncertainties relating to the
        Issuer or the Notes that are not currently known to the Issuer,
        or that the Issuer currently deems immaterial, may individually or cumulatively also have a material adverse
        effect on the business, prospects, results of operations and/or financial position of the Issuer and its
        subsidiaries, the value of the Notes and, if any such risk should occur,
        the price of the Notes may decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment.
        Investors should consider carefully whether an investment in the Notes is suitable for them in light of the
        informa- tion in this Prospectus and their personal circumstances.</p>
      <p class="">Risks relating to the Issuer:</p>
      <p>The sections of the Prospectus entitled "Risks relating to the Issuer" set out a description of the risk
        factors that are material to Genie Capital as a going concern in order to assess the risk associated with the
        dealing with the company.</p>
      <p class="data-head">Business Risk:</p>
      <p>There is the possibility of Genie Capital not making adequate profits due to uncertainties in the general busi-
        ness environment such as changes in tastes, changing preferences of landlords or tenants, increased compe-
        tition from new players who find the market interesting etc.
      </p>
      <p class="data-head">Technology Risk:</p>
      <p>
        Given that we will be very reliant on information technology, there is the possibility of Genie Capital
        experiencing huge losses as a result of failure in its information and communication technology systems.
      </p>
      <p class="data-head">Financial Risk:</p>
      <p>
        With the funds from these notes, we will be taking calculated risk on the real estate properties we buy the
        rights over. As such, we stand chances that these investments may not play out as we expect.
      </p>
      <p class="data-head">Compliance Risk:</p>
      <p>Given that investments are a regulated activity in CEMAC, Genie Capital is exposed to changing regulations that
        may lead to penalties, financial forfeiture and material loss resulting in non-compliance.
      </p>
      <p class="data-head">Political risk:</p>
      <p>
        Genie Capital is headquartered in Buea, SW - Cameroon which is currently experiencing a war between the
        country's military and Anglophone separatist fighters
      </p>
      <p class="data-head">Risks relating to the Notes:</p>
      <p>The sections of the Prospectus entitled "Risks relating to particular Notes" set out a description of the risk
        factors that are material to the Notes in order to assess the market risk associated with the Notes.</p>
      <p class="data-head">Liquidity Risk:</p>
      <p>The Notes may not easily find a market, as such, investors may find it difficult to exchange their Notes for
        cash or much more liquid assets.</p>
      <p class="data-head">Credit Risk:</p>
      <p>
        Genie Capital may fail to meet its obligations (weekly interest payments or redemption) with respect to the
        Notes.

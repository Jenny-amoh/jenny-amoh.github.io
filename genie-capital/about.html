    <h3>A Breif History</h3>
    <p>Genie Capital has been in the works since 2007 when our Managing Director, Otto B. Isong co-founded Carbon Group
      with two friends. Over time, he moved unto other projects and businesses like TopUpDesk (an online airtime top up
      utility, defunct), Pursar (a digital payment platform, morphed to Pursar Technologies), School of Petroleum
      Logistics (a higher institute for petroleum business, defunct), Akwajobs.com etc.Over these experiences, Otto
      realized one of the biggest limitations to Cameroon's development is our inability to raise capital to fund the
      development of infrastructure and nascent technologies. In 2013, he started re- searching and testing some
      concepts that would eventually lead to Genie Capital.</p>
    <p>In 2020, Otto partnered with one of his friends in setting up Genie Capital. It was agreed among them to carry
      out a research and pilot on Taxi Fleet, which was thought to be the first business opportunity. However, from the
      pilot, it was identified that a lot more is needed to get Taxi Fleet to be operational and profitable. Given that
      Otto was already managing some properties as a side hustle, Property Management was then decided to be the first
      product.Genie Capital was incorporated as a private limited liability company with headquarters in Buea, SWR
      Cameroon in August 2021. Enjema Kulu was recruited as the first employee and Sales Represen- tative in August
      2021.
    </p>
    <p>In October 2021, Genie Capital launched Property Management Notes (PM Notes) as a means of raising capi- tal for
      its unique take on Property Management. <a href="#" class="link-dark link-dark1"> Click here to see them</a>
    </p>
    <p>Today, Genie Capital manages properties in Fako, SWR Cameroon worth over 500 million F CFA.</p>
